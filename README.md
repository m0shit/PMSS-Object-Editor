# PMSS-Object-Editor
A tool for Paper Mario Sticker Star that can edit in-game object data and files.
# Note: this tool isn't finished. As of now there is only a "template" of what it's going to be.
The template can be run inside VS Code, or really anything that supports Python, but i'd recommend VS Code.
